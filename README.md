# Econ 140

Welcome to the repository for **Econ 140** section materials! This repository contains a series of lecture slides and resources designed to help students understand key econometric concepts, including regression analysis, instrumental variables (IV), differences-in-differences (DiD), and more.
Feel free to use the slides with an acknowledgement for me - and I'm always happy about feedback or in case you find any mistakes!


## Overview

This repository includes lecture slides created using the Beamer class in LaTeX with the Metropolis theme. The slides cover various econometric topics tailored for undergraduate economics courses focused on an intuitive understanding of modern causal inference tools, without being (overly) formal.


## Sections

Below is a breakdown of the sections included in this repository:


| Section | Title | Key Topics Covered |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | Introduction| Why correlation does not imply causality |
| 2 | Counterfactuals and Selection Bias | Selection bias, potential outcomes framework, causal claims. |
| 3 | Regression in Action | Omitted variable bias (OVB), quadratic terms, hypothesis testing. |
| 4 | Advanced Regression Techniques | Interaction terms, binary dependent variables. |
| 5 | Midterm Preparation | Practice problems on regression and causal inference. |
| 6 | Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) | RCT design, omitted variable bias, bad controls. |
| 7 | Introduction to Instrumental Variables | IV setup, assumptions (relevance, exogeneity, exclusion). |
| 8 | Instrumental Variables: Practice | Real-world IV examples, LATE interpretation. |
| 9 | Differences-in-Differences | Parallel trends assumption, DiD estimation via regression. |
| 10 | Exercises on Instrumental Variables | Advanced IV applications and exam preparation. |
| 11 | From Diff-in-Diff to Panel Data | Fixed effects regressions, panel data limitations. |
| 12 | Regression discontinuity | RD design and applications, final exam exercises. |

## Key Topics

### Core Concepts:

1. **Regression Analysis**: Learn how to interpret coefficients, address omitted variable bias, and use quadratic/interaction terms.
2. **Randomized Controlled Trials**: Learn the fundamentals of RCTs and their role in causal inference.
3. **Instrumental Variables**: Understand when and how to use IVs to address endogeneity issues.
4. **Differences-in-Differences**: Explore causal inference using 2x2 designs and the parallel trends assumption.
5. **Panel Data**: Generalizing differences-in-differences.
4. **Regression discontinuity**: Use arbitrary cut-offs to estimate local causal effects.
